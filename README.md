# Guide to contribute into the project by branch.
- First you have to install GitHub Desktop or Git ( if you are a professional )
- Then clone the repository with this link https://github.com/TranAnhQuoc23521313/UIT_HHQN_SnakeGame.git
- You can set the locate file anywhere in your device but I think you should set locate file in default
- After cloning the project, you can fix or update the code.
- After that, you have to push it into a branch ( follow the rules in Step to work part) by this step:
- Click the branch -> new branch -> type the name of the branch -> Create the branch
- In the Current branch, click into it then a table will be shown for all branch in the project. Chose the branch that you have already created.
- Finally, you only need to click Push to finish the progress
